</td>
<td> double
</td>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> allow-collider-multiple
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 0
</td>
<td> Set this true to enable the use of a DoubleBitMask or QuadBitMask to manage many colliders added to a single traverser in one pass.  If this is false, a one-word BitMask is always used instead, which is faster per pass, but may require more passes.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> allow-flatten-color
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 0
</td>
<td> allows color to always be flattened to vertices
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> allow-incomplete-render
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 1
</td>
<td> When this is true, the frame may be rendered even if some of the geometry in the scene has been paged out, or if the textures are unavailable.  The nonresident geometry and textures will be rendered as soon as they can be read from disk, which may be several frames in the future.  When this is false, geometry is always paged in immediately when needed, holding up the frame render if necessary.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> allow-live-flatten
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 1
</td>
<td> Set this true to allow the use of flatten_strong() or any variant on a node that is attached to a live scene graph node, or false to disallow this.  Flattening a live scene graph node can cause problems when threading is enabled.  This variable only has an effect when Panda is not compiled for a release build.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> allow-nonpipeline-threads
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 0
</td>
<td> This variable should only be set true for debugging or development purposes.  When true, the threading-model variable may specify a threaded pipeline mode, even if pipelining is not compiled in.  This will certainly result in erroneous behavior, and quite likely will cause a crash.  Do not set this unless you know what you are doing.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> allow-portal-cull
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 0
</td>
<td> Set this true to enable portal clipping.  This will enable the renderer to cull more objects that are clipped if not in the current list of portals.  This is still somewhat experimental.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> allow-unrelated-wrt
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 1
</td>
<td> Set this true to allow unrelated NodePaths (that is, nodes which have no common ancestor) to be adjusted relative to each other.  If true, these will be treated as if they had a common node above their top nodes.
</td></tr>

</td>
<td> The minimum number of alpha buffer bits requested.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> alpha-scale-via-texture
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 1
</td>
<td> When this is true, Panda will try to implement ColorScaleAttribs that affect alpha by creating an additional Texture layer over the geometry with a uniform alpha scale applied everywhere, if there is at least one available Texture slot available on the multitexture pipeline.  Set this false to avoid this trickery, so that texturing is only enabled when the application specifically enables it.  See also color-scale-via-lighting.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> anim-blend-type
</td>
<td> enum
</td>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> async-bind-priority
</td>
<td> int
</td>
<td> 100
</td>
<td> This specifies the priority assign to an asynchronous bind task when it is requested via PartBundle::load_bind_anim().  This controls the relative order in which asynchronous loads happen (in particular, relative to asynchronous texture or model loads).  A higher number here makes the animations load sooner.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> async-load-delay
</td>
<td> double
</td>
<td> 0.0
</td>
<td> If this is nonzero, it represents an artificial delay, in seconds, that is imposed on every asynchronous load attempt (within the thread).  Its purpose is to help debug errors that may occur when an asynchronous load is delayed.  The delay is per-model, and all aync loads will be queued up behind the delay--it is as if the time it takes to read a file is increased by this amount per read.

<td> audio-active

<tr>
<td> audio-buffering-seconds
</td>
<td> double
</td>
<td> 3.0
</td>
<td> Controls the amount of audio buffering when streaming audio. If you are playing a streaming sound, and any single frame takes longer than this, the audio will stutter.  Caution: buffering streaming audio takes a lot of memory.  For example, 5 seconds of stereo audio at 44,100 samples/sec takes one megabyte.  The 3-second default is intentionally high, favoring correctness over efficiency, but for a commercial application you may wish to lower this.
</td></tr>

</td>
<td> int
</td>
<td> 1000000
</td>
<td> If the decompressed size of a sound file exceeds this amount, then Panda3D will not attempt to store that sound file in RAM. Instead, it will stream the sound file from disk.  It is not practical to stream multiple sound-files from disk at the same time - the hard drive seek time makes it stutter.

<td> Set this true to automatically detect and break reference-count cycles in the TransformState and RenderState caches.  When this is false, you must explicitly call TransformState.clear_cache() from time to time to prevent gradual memory bloat.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> auto-flip
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 0
</td>
<td> This indicates the initial setting of the auto-flip flag.  Set it true to cause render_frame() to flip all the windows before it returns (in single-threaded mode only), or false to wait until an explicit call to flip_frame() or the next render_frame().  Setting it true gets more immediate response time, while setting it false can get a better frame rate as more is achieved in parallel with the graphics card.

<td> The default endianness to use for writing major numeric data tables to bam files.  This does not affect all numbers written to bam files, only those for which the individual object was designed to support this flag.  The default is "native"; you may set it to "littleendian" or "bigendian" to target a particular platform.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> bam-stdfloat-double
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 0
</td>
<td> The default width of floating-point numbers to write to a bam file.  Set this true to force doubles (64-bit floats), or false to force singles (32-bit floats).

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> basic-shaders-only
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> #f  (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded
</td>
<td> Set this to true if you aren't interested in shader model three and beyond.  Setting this flag will cause panda to disable bleeding-edge shader functionality which tends to be unreliable or broken.  At some point, when functionality that is currently flaky becomes reliable, we may expand the definition of what constitutes 'basic' shaders.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> bmp-bpp

<td> bounds-type
</td>
<td> enum
</td>
<td> sphere
</td>
<td> Specify the type of bounding volume that is created automatically by Panda to enclose geometry.  Use 'sphere' or 'box', or use 'best' to let Panda decide which is most appropriate.  You can also use 'fastest' if you don't want Panda to waste much time computing the most optimal bounding volume.

</td>
<td> This names the certificate authority file for OpenSSL to use to verify whether SSL certificates are trusted or not.  The file named by this setting should contain one or more PEM-formatted certificates from trusted certificate authorities.  This is a fairly standard file; a copy of ca-bundle.crt is included in the OpenSSL distribution, and is also included with Panda.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> cache-check-timestamps
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 1
</td>
<td> Set this true to check the timestamps on disk (when possible) before reloading a file from the in-memory cache, e.g. via ModelPool, TexturePool, etc.  When this is false, a model or texture that was previously loaded and is still found in the ModelPool is immediately returned without consulting the disk, even if the file on disk has recently changed.  When this is true, the file on disk is always checked to ensure its timestamp has not recently changed; and if it has, the in-memory cache is automatically invalidated and the file is reloaded from disk.  This is not related to on-disk caching via model-cache-dir, which always checks the timestamps.

<tr>
<td> clock-degrade-factor
</td>
<td> double
</td>

If you specify only one value, it will represent the total value for the red, green and blue channels, and indicates you don't care how the bits are divided up among the red, green and blue channels.  If you specify three values, it represents three separate red, green and blue bit requirements.

This avoids the need to munge the vertex data to change each vertex's color.  Set this false to avoid this trickery, so that lighting is only enabled when the application specifically enables it.  See also alpha-scale-via-texture.

</td>
<td> The quality level is an integer number that generally ranges between 0 and 100, where smaller numbers indicate greater compression at the cost of quality, and larger numbers indicate higher quality but less compression.  Generally, 95 is the highest useful value; values between 95 and 100 produce substantially larger, but not substantially better, output files.  This is akin to the JPEG compression level.

<td> Set this true to send a batch of triangle strips to the graphics card as one long triangle strip, connected by degenerate triangles, or false to send them as separate triangle strips with no degenerate triangles.  On PC hardware, using one long triangle strip may help performance by reducing the number of separate graphics calls that have to be made.

The issue is that on Windows, OpenSSL will attempt to randomize its seed by crawling through the entire heap of allocated memory, which can be extremely large in a Panda application, especially if you have already opened a window and started rendering; and so this can take as much as 30 seconds or more.

However, some very buggy graphics drivers may have problems handling vertex arrays correctly, so if you are experiencing problems you might try setting this to false.  If this is false, Panda will fall back to using immediate-mode commands like glVertex3f(), etc., to issue the vertices, which is potentially much slower than vertex arrays.  Setting this false also disables vertex buffers, effectively ignoring the setting of the vertex-buffers variable (since vertex buffers are a special case of vertex arrays in OpenGL).  This variable is normally not enabled in a production build.  This has no effect on DirectX rendering.

<td> vertex-buffers
</td>

<td> 1
</td>
<td> Set this true to allow the use of vertex buffers (or buffer objects, as OpenGL dubs them) for rendering vertex data.  This can greatly improve rendering performance on higher-end graphics cards, at the cost of some additional graphics memory (which might otherwise be used for textures or offscreen buffers).  On lower-end graphics cards this will make little or no difference.

<tr>
<td> vertex-column-alignment
</td>
<td> int
</td>
<td> 4
</td>
<td> This specifies the default byte alignment for each column of data within a GeomVertexData when it is assembled using the default interfaces.  Normally, you should not change this config variable (which would change this value globally), but instead specify any alignment requirements on a per-column basis as you construct a GeomVertexFormat.  Setting this value globally could result in much needless wasted space in all vertex data objects, but it could be useful for simple experiments.  Also see vertex-animation-align-16 for a variable that controls this alignment for the vertex animation columns only.

<td> When this is nonzero (and Panda has been compiled with thread support) then this number of sub-threads will be spawned to evict vertex pages to disk and read them back again.  When this is 0, this work will be done in the main thread, which may introduce occasional random chugs in rendering.

<td> vertices-float64
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 0
</td>
<td> When this is true, the default float format for vertices will be a 64-bit double-precision float, instead of the normal 32-bit single-precision float.  This must be set at static init time to have the broadest effect.  You almost never want to set this true, since current hardware does not support double-precision vertices, and setting this will just require the driver to downsample the vertices at load time, making everything slower.

<td> Set this true to make the VirtualFileSystem present the native OS-provided filesystem as if it were a case-sensitive file system, even if it is not (e.g. on Windows).  This variable has no effect if the native filesystem is already case-sensitive, and it has no effect on mounted multifile systems, which are always case-sensitive.

<tr>
<td> vfs-implicit-mf
</td>
<td> bool
</td>
<td> 0
</td>
<td> When this is true, the VirtualFileSystem will automatically mount multifiles on-the-fly when they are used as directories.  For instance, opening the file /c/files/foo.mf/dirname/mytex.jpg will implicitly retrieve a file named 'dirname/mytex.jpg' within the multifile /c/files/foo.mf, even if the multifile has not already been mounted.  This makes all of your multifiles act like directories.

<td> When this is true, the VirtualFileSystem will pretend a named file exists even if it doesn't, as long as a filename with the same name and the additional extension .pz does exist.  In this case, the VirtualFileSystem will implicitly open the .pz file and decompress it on-the-fly.
