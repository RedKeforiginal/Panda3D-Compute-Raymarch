# Panda3D-Compute-Raymarch

A proof-of-concept ray marching program using Panda3D.

Version 0.1 will:

1. Render one of several complex SDFs with configurable settings.
2. Allow users to explore the SDF with a first person camera, WSAD for horizontal movement, spacebar and ctrl for vertical movement, and mouse look.
3. Utilize full Disney Principled BSDF with the ability to configure or disable specific components.
4. Provide a suite of procedurally generated materials with non-repeating patterns based on distance for world center (x,y,z). Translucent materials like glass will be supported.
5. Utilize a dynamic point light grid.
6. Implement a water layer with a realistic animated surface that occupies all empty space beneath a certain altitude.
7. Provide a UI with an options menu to configure settings.
