# Panda3D-Compute-Raymarch

A proof-of-concept ray marching program using Panda3D.

Version 0.1 will:

1. render a complex, infinite SDF.
2. allow users to explore the SDF with WSAD for horizontal movement, spacebar and ctrl for vertical movement, and mouse look.
3. utilize full BRDF, PBR, and ray marched shadows.
4. provide a default procedurally generated material the is not tiled, but seemingly infinite and non-repeating.
5. light the scene with an infinite dynamic point light grid whose spacing and offset is configurable by the user.
6. provide a UI with an options menu to configure settings.
