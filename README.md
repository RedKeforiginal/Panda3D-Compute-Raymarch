# Panda3D-Compute-Raymarch

A proof-of-concept ray marching program using Panda3D.

Version 0.1 will:

1. render a complex, infinite SDF.
2. allow users to explore the SDF with WSAD for horizontal movement, spacebar and ctrl for vertical movement, and mouse look.
3. utilize full BRDF, PBR, and ray marched shadows.
4. provide a default procedurally generated material the is not tiled, but seemingly infinite and non-repeating.
5. light the scene with a dynamic point light grid centered on the world origin whose spacing and offset are configurable by the user.
6. provide a UI with an options menu to configure settings.

7. optionally use a camera-centered 2x2x2 light grid via the Lighting menu.
