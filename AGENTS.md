Agents must reference Panda3D documentation (docs.panda3d.org) when working on Python scripts and OpenGL documentation (docs.gl) when working on shaders.

Agents should ensure that any Python scripts that they modify compile with those additions.

This project expects profession quality rendering. Agents must use the most robust, complete, and high quality version of any algorithm that they utilize. Agents must not use shortcuts, placeholders, or simplifications of established rendering algorithms, instead only using the full, proper, correct versions rendering algorithms. Overall, quality more important than performance for the sake of this project. If an agent has any doubt, they must consult published examples of such algorithms.

Agents will be unable to test the visual aspects of the program. This will be the responsibility of human users, who will report any visual bugs.
