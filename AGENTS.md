Agents must reference Panda3D documentation (docs.panda3d.org) when working on Python scripts and OpenGL documentation (docs.gl) when working on shaders.

Agents should ensure that any Python scripts that they modify compile with those additions.

Agents will be unable to test the visual aspects of the program. This will be the responsibility of human users, who will report any visual bugs.
